# munin-imap-plugin
Checks the number of messages in an IMAP account using the Python library 'imaplib'.

This work is based on plugin for the Nagios monitoring framework
originally created by Bertera Pietro (2005) and extended by Bernhard Schmidt (2012).

Additionally there is a script to check the IMAP capabilites of a given server.
